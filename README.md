Naive implementation of the paper "Alternative Solutions for Continuous K Nearest Neighbor Queries in Spatial Network Databases." published by Kolahdouzan, Mohammad &amp; Shahabi, Cyrus (2005).

## Acknowledgements
To compute the edge network voronoi diagram I used the work https://github.com/sabrinadchan/nearest-L-station. My contribution to the ENVD solution of [sabrinadchan](https://github.com/sabrinadchan) are mainly refactorings. The related [blog post](https://sabrinadchan.github.io/data-blog/computing-a-network-voronoi-diagram.html) was a tremendous help in understanding the implementation.
